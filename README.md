## Game Summary:
Explore a long-abandoned facility, originally the international government energy project known as Project Prometheus, that is being taken over by an awakening facility management AI. You will switch between 4 items using the Item Cyclers dispersed around the facility. For added efficiency and safety, you will be terminated if you do not reach the next Item Cycler within 20 seconds. Fight your way through robot drones, corrupted drills, and challenging platforming segments.

## Technical Requirments & Information:

- We are using [Godot 4.2](https://godotengine.org/), which requires the machine to support the Vulkan graphics library. We will also export a compatibility version which uses [OpenGL 3.0](https://www.opengl.org/) (GLES3), which might have visual bugs/artifacts, but this will not be the official release.
- There will be an option for an efficiency mode so that the game can run on most mid-range and some low-range laptops.
- We have working exports for Windows, Linux, and Mac. The game will also be able to run on a browser using itch.io.
- This game is designed to be used with a keyboard and a mouse or a bluetooth/USB controller.
- We have an efficiency mode which removes most particle systems and changes some calculations, so our game can run on most computers.
- Godot uses [GDscript](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html), which is Godot’s own programming language, along with GLSL for shaders.
- We’re using [Beepbox](https://www.beepbox.co/) (and some Beepbox [mods](https://ultraabox.github.io/)) for music, [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) for editing voice lines and recorded sound effects.
- We are using [LibreSprite](https://libresprite.github.io/#!/) (A free and open source fork of Aseprite) and [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) (GNU Image Manipulation Program) to make textures, which will be pixel art.
