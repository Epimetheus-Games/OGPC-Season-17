## Game Summary:
You play as a human in a very gray and bleak facility, fighting your way through robot drones, drills, and challenging platforming segments. You have 20 seconds to switch to a specific new item in a cycle, and otherwise you die.

## Technical Requirments & Information:

- We are using Godot 4.2, which requires the machine to support the Vulkan graphics library. We will also export a compatibility version which uses OpenGL 3.0 (GLES3), which might have visual bugs/artifacts, but this will not be the official release.
- There will be an option for an efficiency mode so that the game can run on most mid-range and some low-range laptops.
- We will have working exports for Windows, Linux, and Mac. The game will also be able to run on a browser using HTML5.
- This game is designed to be used with a keyboard and a mouse or a bluetooth/USB controller.
- We have an efficiency mode which removes most particle systems and changes some calculations, so our game can run on most computers.
- You probably need at least 1 GB of RAM to run.
- Godot uses gdscript, which is Godot’s own programming language, along with GLSL for shaders.
- We’re using Beepbox (and some Beepbox mods), and GarageBand (all with custom-made loops (we recorded our own instrument and/or created the entire melody)) for music, Audacity for editing voice lines and recorded sound effects, and possibly SFXR for more rudimentary sounds.
- We are using LibreSprite (A free and open source fork of Aseprite) and GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) to make textures, which will be pixel art.
